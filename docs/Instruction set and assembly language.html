An Assembly Language program consists of a sequence of 
lines;  each line says what's in one word of memory (except for
the W data format).  A 
line begins with zero or more labels; each label is an
identifier followed by a colon.  After that, the line 
is either in instruction format or in data format.  
Instruction format is an op-code followed by an address. 
The op-code is three 
letters, and the address is either a number or an identifier.  Data 
format is one of I (for 2's complement integer), F (for 
IEEE floating point number), C (for ASCII character), B 
(for binary), H (for hexadecimal), A (for address), or W (for word) followed by the 
indicated data.  The W format reserves the indicated number of words
of memory.  The 
remainder of any line can be used for comments.  W 0 can be used just for a
label, or just for a comment.  Here 
is a sequence of example lines (this is not a sensible 
program).<br>
</p><pre> main: LDA x
       ADD c3
       STA y
       BUN there
    x: I   0
    y: F   -1.2e3
   c3: I   3
there: BUN opsys
</pre>
Execution starts at label <code>main</code> .
Execution of your program ends with a branch to 
the operating system at address <code>opsys</code>.  
All identifiers used as addresses, except <code>opsys</code>, should 
be defined as labels.  An identifier cannot be defined more 
than once as a label.<br>
